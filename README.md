## 6. Usage Example

The search engine is designed to capture complete searches and filter out incomplete ones. Here's an example:

1. **User Searches (because itâ€™s instant, it records it all):**

   - (1st (random) user searches for)
     - What is
     - What is a
     - What is a good car

   - (2nd (random) user searches for:)
     - How is
     - How is emil hajric
     - How is emil hajric doing

2. **Your search engine only records:**
   - What is a good car
   - How is emil hajric doing

And removes the rest because it was an incomplete search.


Your backend will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:3000/.

Now you have the Searchbox application up and running locally. Feel free to explore and customize it according to your needs.
